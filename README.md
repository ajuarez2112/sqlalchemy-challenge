In this assignment I took a look at the data provided for multiple stations in Hawaii. I then performed queries for specific information in the climate_starter.ipynb file. After acquiring and organizing the information I then created the app.py file to create an API using the information found in the climate_starter.ipynb file. The home screen shows all routes available. Each route shows specific different information.
